                <p>We are Bronx Science students who want to provide more coding opportunities for our community. Hello, World! We are the AtomHacks Committee in Bronx Science, a team dedicated to helping others explore coding, whether they are beginners or advanced. Through workshops and opportunities to work in teams, we hope to create a friendly and enjoyable environment where anyone can inquire ideas based on the skillset that they are exposed to. Coding shouldn't be intimidating, and we hope that through this hackathon, we can bring our school community together, especially during these tough times.</p>

                            I am a junior at the Bronx Science, where I am part of the AtomHacks Committee where we
                            organize hackathons to offer all students an opportunity to design tech projects. I joined
                            this committee because I’ve always loved coding and have done a lot of outreach as
                            well so this was something I was really interested in. I advocate for women in STEM so
                            hopefully one day, we can fix the gender disparity in that field.

                            I joined the AtomHacks team because I wanted to somehow make a contribution in bringing the
                            community together for the upcoming hackathon this year!
                            Some of my interests include reading and writing in my free time as well as involving myself
                            in
                            photography and journaling.
                            I’m glad to be a part of the team!
